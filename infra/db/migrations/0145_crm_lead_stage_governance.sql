-- Gate 4 — CRM lead lifecycle governance.

-- Replaces arbitrary "SET stage" (last-writer-wins) with governed transitions:
-- an optimistic-concurrency revision, a legal-transition graph enforced in the
-- application (@expadio/lead), and a hash-chained, append-only audit of every
-- move with actor + reason. The capture 19-stage journey already has its own
-- governed history (0127); this is the thin CRM projection's equivalent.
