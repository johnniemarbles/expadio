-- Extend crm_leads with geography and structured enquiry payload fields.

-- first_name / last_name: split from contact_name (0156); contact_name
--   remains for legacy rows and is populated as first_name || ' ' || last_name
--   by the application layer on new inserts.
-- country_code / region_or_state / city / postal_code: geography for
--   territory matching and routing. country_code is ISO 3166-1 alpha-2.
-- enquiry_payload: jsonb bag of interest-type-specific self-declared data
--   collected at manual lead entry (mirrors hosted-form capture payload
--   structure from interest-payload.ts). Indexed for JSONB containment queries.
