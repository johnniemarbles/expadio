BEGIN;

-- Extend crm_leads with contact-identity fields for manually entered leads.
--
-- Previously, manual leads only captured a title and financial fields.
-- Brand operators need to record the prospect's name, email, phone, and
-- the interest type they enquired about — the same information a lead
-- would submit through a hosted form.
--
-- contact_name, contact_email, contact_phone: the individual who made
--   the enquiry. Nullable for historical rows and programmatic leads that
--   attach a crm_contact via contact_id instead.
-- enquiry_interest_type / enquiry_opportunity_type: the commercial interest
--   the prospect expressed. Kept separate from the schema-level
--   interest_type on lead_management_configurations; this is the prospect's
--   self-declared interest recorded at lead creation time.
-- raw_payload: already exists as jsonb; this migration does not change it.
